"""
Trial-level resampling for phase comparisons.

A *phase* is a pooled trial set — whatever ``filter_trials`` returned, treated as
one mega-session. These engines turn a phase into a distribution of statistic
values, so uncertainty can be attached to any contrast built from them.

    load_experiment → select_sessions → filter_trials → phase

Two engines, two jobs — they are not interchangeable:

**Bootstrap** resamples trials with labels fixed. It answers "how precisely is
this quantity pinned down", and is valid wherever the trials were sampled, which
is everywhere. Use it for confidence intervals, and for any contrast between
phases that were not randomised against each other (masking sessions vs opto
sessions were recorded on different days, so no shuffle mimics the design).

**Permutation** shuffles the condition label to build a null. It answers "could
the label be irrelevant", and is only meaningful when the label was assigned in a
way the shuffle reproduces. Opto was randomised per trial by the rig, so
permuting opto/non-opto *within a phase* is well grounded. Permuting a
session-level property across trials is not.

Composition rule: bootstrap each condition once, keep the draws, and build every
contrast by subtracting draw frames. Differences of differences then work
directly, and a shared reference cancels exactly — ``(A - C) - (B - C)`` uses the
*same* ``C`` draws, so its variance drops out instead of being double-counted.

Every engine returns a ``pd.DataFrame`` of draws: one row per draw, one column
per stat, columns in request order, NaN where a draw failed.

    Delegates to :func:`behav_utils.analysis.downsample.resample_stat_vectors`,
    the library's single resample-and-recompute engine, so the frozen lag-1
    ``prev_*`` pairing survives every draw (a repeated trial carries its own
    predecessor).

    ``unit='trials'`` (default) is a per-trial bootstrap, stratified by stimulus
    bin, and answers "how precisely is this phase's stat pinned by its trials".
    ``unit='sessions'`` resamples whole sessions with replacement instead: it
    treats the session as the independent unit, so the interval reflects
    session-to-session scatter (the right unit when the phase spans sessions that
    were not randomised per trial — e.g. an opto phase vs a masking phase). A
    matched ``n_trials`` only applies to the trial bootstrap.

    The trial draw is stratified by stimulus bin: the stimulus composition is
    held roughly fixed across draws because the stimulus set is fixed by the
    design, so the interval is conditional on it (slightly narrower than an
    unconditional bootstrap). The session draw is unstratified.

    Args:
        phase:    list of SessionData from ``filter_trials``.
        names:    scalar stat names. For ``unit='trials'`` these must be
                  trial-exchangeable; ``unit='sessions'`` accepts any stat.
        n_draws:  number of resamples.
        n_trials: trial bootstrap only — draw this many trials instead of the
                  natural count (a matched n for equal-precision contrasts).

    Only use this where the label really was randomised per trial. Opto vs

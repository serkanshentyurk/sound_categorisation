"""
Statistic registry.

Contract
--------
A **statistic** is a float computed from a :class:`TrialArrays`. Every
producer has the same signature::

    def f(arrays: TrialArrays, *, rng: np.random.Generator) -> float
    def g(arrays: TrialArrays, *, rng: np.random.Generator) -> tuple[float, ...]

``rng`` is always passed; deterministic producers ignore it.

Two decorators register producers:

- ``@stat(name, exchangeable=True)`` — one scalar.
- ``@fit(name, outputs=(...), exchangeable=True)`` — one fitter yielding
  several named scalars (a psychometric fit gives ``mu, sigma, lapse_low,
  lapse_high``). Each output is a first-class stat name; the fitter runs once
  per :func:`compute_stats` call however many of its outputs are requested.

``compute_stats(arrays, names)`` returns a float ``pd.Series`` indexed by the
requested names, in request order. Nothing else is ever returned: no dicts,
no arrays, no family names. Array-valued readouts (update matrix, curves)
live in ``behav_utils.readouts``, not here.

``exchangeable`` records whether trial-level resampling is valid for the
producer: True for memoryless and lag-1 statistics (they use the frozen
``prev_*`` view), False for anything that depends on trial order beyond
lag 1 (multi-lag regressions, run-length measures). Resamplers consult
:func:`is_exchangeable` and refuse to trial-resample a non-exchangeable stat.
